# Work in Progress

## Overview
Currently brainstorming ideas for the project. This phase involves conceptualizing the purpose, structure, and implementation details. The project aims to simulate phishing attacks by creating a fake website and sending fake emails, all strictly for educational or security testing purposes.

## Goals
1. **Develop a fake phishing website**
   - Clone a target website layout.
   - Capture credentials entered by test users.

2. **Implement email spoofing scripts**
   - Use Python to send emails impersonating organizations.
   - Configure SMTP servers securely.

3. **Provide a framework for ethical security testing**
   - Ensure all actions comply with legal standards.
   - Include ethical disclaimers and documentation.

### Workflow
1. Set up the environment:
   - Install necessary Python libraries.
   - Configure tools like Ngrok for exposing local servers.
2. Create a fake website using Flask.
3. Test locally before deploying.
4. Develop and test the email spoofing script.
5. Document all steps clearly for reproducibility.

## Legal and Ethical Considerations
- **Purpose:** Educational and security testing only.
- **Consent:** Obtain written consent from targets before testing.
- **Compliance:** Follow all relevant laws and regulations.

## Current Status
- Researching tools and techniques.
- Sketching project structure and initial ideas.
